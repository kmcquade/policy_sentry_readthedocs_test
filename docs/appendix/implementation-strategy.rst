Implementation Strategy
-----------------------

In the context of your overall organization strategy for AWS IAM, we recommend using a few measures for locking down your AWS environments with IAM:


#. Use `policy_sentry <https://github.com/salesforce/policy_sentry/>`_ to create `Identity-based policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html>`_
#. Use Service Control Policies (SCPs) to lock down available API calls per account.

   * A great collection of SCPs can be found `here <https://asecure.cloud/l/scp/>`_.
   * Control Tower has some excellent guidance on strategy for SCPs in their documentation. Note that they call it "Guardrails" but they are mostly SCPs. See the docs `here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/guardrails-reference.html>`_

#. Use `Repokid <https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/introducing-aardvark-and-repokid-53b081bf3a7e>`_ to revoke out of date policies as your application/roles mature.
#. Use `Resource-based policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html>`_ for all services that support them. 

   * A list of which services support resource-based policies can be found `here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html>`_.

#. Never provision infrastructure manually; use Infrastructure as Code 

   * I highly suggest Terraform for IAC over other alternatives such as CloudFormation, Chef, or Puppet. See the Gruntwork blog post [here][6]; Yevgeniy Brikman explains the reasons very well.
   * I also suggest reading HashiCorp's `Unlocking the Cloud Operating Model Whitepaper <https://www.hashicorp.com/cloud-operating-model>`_.
