Roadmap
===========

* Condition Keys

Currently, Condition Keys are not supported by this script. For an example, see the KMS key Condition Key Table [here][https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_awskeymanagementservice.html#awskeymanagementservice-policy-keys]. Note: The database does create a table of condition keys in case we develop future support for it, but it isn't used yet.


* Log-based policy generation
